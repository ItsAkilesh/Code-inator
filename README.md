## Use python-3.10 only

This project uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to automate software engineering tasks. When a user provides a directive, the system analyzes the overall objective and decomposes it into a series of tasks and subtasks. Each subtask is defined to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the development process.

The system then generates code for each subtask, implementing the required logic and functionality. Abstraction and implementation steps are handled programmatically to convert user requirements into working software components.

After processing all subtasks, the system assembles the final output, delivering a solution that aligns with the user's specifications. The approach is designed to streamline software development by automating planning, task decomposition, and code generation.

## Architecture

![App Screenshot](/screenshots/Workflow1.jpg)
- The user prompts the application with the project requirements and outcomes. 
- The bot divides the tasks into a series of sub-problems. 
- Each of the sub-problem is assigned to separate agents fo solving. 
- A test agent generates test cases for each of the functions generated by the coder agents. 
- If the tests are sucessfull, then the code is pushed to another agents which stitches up multiple pieces of code else, the code is corrected for those generated testcases.
